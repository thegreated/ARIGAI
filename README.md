Articale Image Generator with AI

This python program you can create an video based only on the article link 
I used OpenAi for article revision , Gemini for Text to speech  and Moviepy for generating the video.
It is under development and i will be updated daily on this project

The goal of this project is to develop an automated video generator for the facebook reels.
I will compile it as an python libraries once done.
Hope you support me

 Thank you.
